# Automations

A repo to learn and test how GitHub Actions and other workflows works

- demo.yaml: basic example of workflow triggered when commits are pushed. It shows some logs.
- manual-failure.yaml: worflow manually triggered with a boolean parameter input. If this input is
true, the workflow will fail and a notificiation will be sent to my personal Discord server.
- gh-cli.yaml: workflow to show GitHub variables.
